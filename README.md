# MS SQL Server container image
An **unofficial**, **unsupported** and **in no way connected to Microsoft** container image for MS SQL Server

~~Resulting container images can be found at the Docker hub ([MS SQL Developer Edition](https://hub.docker.com/r/tobiasfenster/mssql-server-dev-unsupported/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) / [MS SQL Express](https://hub.docker.com/r/tobiasfenster/mssql-server-exp-unsupported/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated))~~ **Update:** I was told by Microsoft that sharing the images on the Docker hub violates the EULA, so I had to remove them.
